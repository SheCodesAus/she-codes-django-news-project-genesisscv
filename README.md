Hello dear reader,

This is my blog project, which contains the following features:

- Stories ordered  by date.
- CSS styling in the form for adding new stories.
- Image url field
- Functional login/logout buttons.
- Account view so authors can see their profile information.
- Account functionality, so a new user can sign up to be an author.
- Filter to view stories by a particular author.
- Function that shows/hides the relevant information and buttons based on whether the user is logged in/out 
- Function that only allows you to create a new story if you are logged in

Heroku links: https://sleepy-anchorage-61589.herokuapp.com/, https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/sleepy-anchorage-61589 ( currently not working :( )

Please see screenshots attached,

I would love to add more features and styling once I have a better understanding of Django!

Thanks for reading!
